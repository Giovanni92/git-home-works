## Some info about me:


I'm 30 years old, born in 1992. Have a specialist degree of systems engineer, _Kherson National Techical University_. Now I'm working as kids' sport trainer but I want to change something in my life. The best way is to learn new and I started to study in _"Web-academy" (HTML/CSS + JS (Front-end Web Development))_.

I choosed this way of education and self-development because:

* *IT is the rapidly developing industry*
* *You can earn the money in comfortable conditions*
* *It's very interesting field of activity*
* *One of the best way to work in team with the same interests*
